#About the project

The purpose of this project is to automate the flow described in the assignment.

##Notes

* I have inserted waits into the test case, you can uncomment those waits to make it easier to follow visually.
* I have assumed that, the case where the number of items that would be added to the cart will be higher than the available item count is not an issue for this scope, therefore I did not implemented accordingly.
